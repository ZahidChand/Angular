Creating New Project In Angular  
You need to have some prerequisite installed in your system
1.Node should be installed

2.npm should be installed

After that all you need to open any code editor and in terminal fire a command 


ng new FolderName to create .

The ng new command prompts you for information about features to include in the initial application project. Accept the defaults by pressing the Enter or Return key.

The Angular CLI installs the necessary Angular npm packages and other dependencies. This can take a few minutes.

It also creates the following workspace and starter project files:

A new workspace, with a root folder named helloWorld
An initial skeleton app project in the src/app subfolder.
Related configuration files.
The initial app project contains a simple Welcome application, ready to run.

To run just simple fire a command ng serve
and after compilation go to browser and type url
localhost:4200 and it will open
