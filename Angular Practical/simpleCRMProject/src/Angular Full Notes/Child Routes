		Child Routes
		
	We can configure child route to create  more meaningful URL segments.
	
	The child routes array will follow syntax and  array concept as similar to  defining the routes array.
	
	Syntax to define the child routes:--
	
		{path : 'products',
			children:[
				{path : 'product-child',component:ProductViewComponent}
			]
		}
		
	We can configure any number of child routes to parent routes.
	
	Using logical group
		
		customers	--> Parent Route
		
		   view		---> Child Routes		URL Will be customer/view	
		   	
		   edit		---> Child Routes		URL Will be customer/edit
		   	
		   delete		---> Child Routes		URL Will be customer/delete
		   
	So this way you can set parent and child routes to look url more understandable.
	
	
	Eg:----
		{ path : 'products',
			childrens:[
				{path:'view',component : ProductViewComponent},
				{path:'edit',component : ProductEditComponent},
				{path:'view/:id',component : ProductIdComponent},
			]
		}
