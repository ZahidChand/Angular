    *** ng Template And ng Container
    
    --->    ng Container
        
        --  In angular we cannot use more than one template binding on an element.
        
        --  Mostly we cannot see that two binding on a same element.
        
        -- So one way to fix that is adding an extra div by adding extra div it helps in redundancy.
        
        -- Another way is that we can add ng container so that we dont need to add extra div .
        
        -- Think of ng container as a external parent element used for wrapping child elements and its not visible in  the dom.
        
    --->    ng Template
      
          -- Angular ng-template defines a template that doesn't render anything by default.
          
          -- Used with structural directives like ngSwitch,ngFor,etc
          
          
          Eg ---> 
              <ng-container *ngIf="isRoleDefined">
                  <div*ngIf="user?.type == 'admin' ; else notAdmin">
                        user is admin
                  </div>

                  <ng-template #notAdmin>
                        user is not admin
                  </ng-template>
              <ng-container>
              
           So here insted of ng-container we can also add div tag
           It will also work fine without an error .
           But by adding ng-container no extra tag will get displayed inside DOM when we inspect in developer tool.
