		Wildcard Routes
	
	Wildcard routes are nothing but whenever user enters a route which is invalid or something which does not exist or kind of 404 which doesnot exist in your application , so wildcard will intercepts that perticular route which is not avaliable in your application and then we can specify that what we should do.
	
	Wild card intercepts any invalid URLs in our application.
	
	When NO matching are found in the routes array, the router doesnot know where to go and hence result in console errors.
	
	Wildcard routes are defined in the routes array using.
	
	Usually a component named PageNotFound is mapped as a best practice.
	
	Every application should have it to handle bad routes, exception etc.
	
	IMP :----  This has to be the last route in your configuration 

	We define by saying the path to match "**"

	So we represent them usiong double **
	
	Syntax : -- {path:'**'}
	
	Eg :
		{path:'**',component:PageNotFound}
	
	This should be in last of all routes not at top not in middle.
	If we write it in middle then it will treate below routes also as PageNotFOund even after there is route of that perticular .
	
	So always define that route at last.
