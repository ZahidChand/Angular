		Redirecting Routes
		
	When we want our route to redirect to another route -- we will implement the redirectTo in our routes arrays.
	
	The syntax to define is given below
		
		{path:",redirectTo:'home',pathMatch:'full'"}
	
	The empty path indicates that its the default route of the application.
	
	The empty path also requires us to mention that pathMatch should be "full" .
	
	
	In simple words when we want to show any single page at very first when we write 
	http://localhost:4200
	the very first page which get display is what is passed inside redirectTo
	then we can display any selected page according to us that .
	
	Eg :---
	If we have redirectTo : 'welcome' then after pasing url localhost:4200 then it will land us to welcome page.
