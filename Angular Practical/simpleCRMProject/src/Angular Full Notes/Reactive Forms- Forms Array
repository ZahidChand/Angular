		Reactive Forms - Forms Array
		
	One of the most important feature working in reactive forms.
	
	For complex forms we need Form Arrays.
	
	Almost all modern application will need us to work with form arrays.
	
	DOM interaction in angular reactive form are implemented using the form arrays.
	
	Adding and removing elements are very easil handled using form arrays.
	
	FormArrays aggrigates  the value of the "child" FormControl into a Array.
	
	The status of the FormArray is calculated by reducing the statuses of its children.
	
	If any one of the control is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.
	
	UserCase  1 :-->
	
	Eg: Define a simple formArray :-->
		
		let users = new FormArray([
			new FormControl('zahid'),
			new FormCOntrol('chand')
		]);
		
		Now console log them and check the value.
		console.log(users)
		console.log(users.value)
		
		In this example we have 2 FormControls and we are grouping them to make an FormArray.
		
		In other words we can say this is an array with 2 formcontrols.
		
	
	UserCase  2 :-->
	
		
	Eg: Array With FormGroup :-->
		
		
		'users' : new FormArray([
			this.fb.group({
				'name':new FormControl('zahid'),
				'age':new FormControl('25'),
				'dept':new FormControl('IT')
			
			})
		])
