Angular is a modular app architecture 

Which means if you are built-in any application then that should be in modular 
architecture.

Eg:
    src
        contact                 ---> This is Module (1 Module have many components)
            add-contact                 ---> This is component 
            edit-contact                ---> This is component
            delete-contact              ---> This is component
            list-contact                ---> This is component

        User                    -->  This is Module 
            add-User                    ---> This is component
            edit-User                   ---> This is component
            list-User                   ---> This is component
            delete-User                 ---> This is component

        report                 -->  This is Module 
            add-report              ---> This is component
            edit-report             ---> This is component
            list-report             ---> This is component


        -->     Shared are something that if we want to use that repo as common 
        in our whole application then its better you write it in shared repo 
        So by doing that you can reuse the code again and again
        
        -->    It helps developer and save time of developer so that developer
        can save time in not re writing that code.

        Shared     
            breadcrumb
            footer
            header

        

        services
            contact.service.ts
            user.service.ts
            order.service.ts

        In service there are all components services so you can write here your
        business logic 
        In short service are reuseable functions that we can use whenever needed.
