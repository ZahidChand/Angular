		FormControl And FormGroup
		
	This are 3 important things in Reactive Form:--

		1. FormControl
		2. FormGroup
		3. FOrmBuilder

	In angular application there are forms and in that forms there are elements like input,radio,textarea checkbox etc. So this are elemenets in forms and that are called FormControl in angular.
	
	And when one or more FormControl are grouped together then its called FormGroup.
	
	

	Whenever we are using Reactive form  in  component then we need to import that in component and also in that module.
		
		Eg:--
			AppModule
			
				userModule ---> Module	------>	(Ractive)
					add-user ----> Component
					(Ractive)		
		
		
	Steps to use Reactive Form --->
		
		Step1 :-->	Import and add in the ReactiveFormModule in the app.module.ts .
		
			- For template driven form  ReactiveFormModule need to be imported .
			- If we DO NOt Import this we will get an error.
			- Add the module into the array list of import.
			
		Step2 :-->	Create the form in app.component.html
			- FormGroup
				- We need to use the directive FormGroup for the entire form and gave it a name.
			
			-FormControlName
				- Every form feild should have a "formControlName" attribute
