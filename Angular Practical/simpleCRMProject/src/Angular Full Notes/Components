Angular Components :---> 

Components are the most important and basic building blocks of Angular apps 


 Authentication --> This Is Module 

    - new-user 
    - login 
    - forgot-password
    - reset-password 

And below rest of it is components.


Component is a smallest functionality that you will implement in your application 

When we group multiple Components it becomes a module 

We can have parent-child relationship of components 

We can have components inside components 

syntax:- ng generate component <component-name>

eg:-
    ng g component add-contact 
    ng g component edit-contact
    ng g component list-contacts 
    ng g component delete-contact 


Every component has 4 files auto-generated with it 
    - component.html -> view or html or template file -> UI 
    - component.ts -> it will be a class file which will have methods -> Logic 
    - component.spec.ts -> It will have the unit test script for component 
    - component.scss -> stylesheet of the component 


Component decorator inside the component.ts file 

    selector -> unique identifier for the component
        -> id of the component 
        -> using this selector we will use the component  
    templateUrl -> your HTML code 
        - component.html file 
    styleURLS -> for linking your component stylesheet 
        - component.scss
