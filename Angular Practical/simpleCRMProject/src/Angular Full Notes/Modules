Modules:----->

    As we know angular is modular based architecture.
    In angular there are lots of modules which are built-In

    - Examples 
        - BrowserModule
        - BrowserAnimationsModule

    - Angular Material Library
        - MatButtonModule
        - MatDropDownModule 

 All the code and functionality is grouped in a module 

 Whenever you see a @ symbol - it's a decorator 


 What modules consist
    - declarations
        - this is where we will add all the components of the module 
    - imports 
        - we can import modules inside a module 
    
    - providers 
        - services that we need will be injected here 
    
    - Bootstrap 
        - what is the first component, the module should load 

    - exports   
        - is to export and expose the component outside of the module  

 Every Angular application should have atleast 1 module 

 By default, the Angular framework provides us with AppModule 

 The AppModule will have a component by the name 
    - AppComponent 
    
 Whenever we are building Angular applications 
    - We will always think of Modules first 

        
Syntax :-- ng generate module <module-name>

eg --> 
        Create a custom Module 
    ng generate module contacts
    ng generate module leads
    ng generate module settings
    ng generate module Opportunites
    ng generate module authentication
