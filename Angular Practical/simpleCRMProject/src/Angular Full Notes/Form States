		Form States In Angular
		
	Angular has a mechanisim to track the forms at all time.
	
	It means whenever we work wioth forms angular knows excatly what state that perticular form is weather its valid, invalid, pristine, pending ,touched untouched and dirty.
	
	1. ng-valid :--> 
		-It tells us weather that form is valid or not.
	
	2. ng-invalid :--> 
		- Same way ng-invalid also return true or false when form s invlid or not.
		- If its invalid it will t=give True and if its Not Invalid then it will give you False.	
	
	3. ng-pnding :-->
		- It check weather the form is pending.

	4. ng-pristine :-->
		- It will tell you that user has touched it but the data was not modified.
		
	5. ng-dirty :-->
		- iT means that the form was touched , the form data was touched and modified.
		
	6. ng-untouched :-->
		- It means that the form controll was never touched.
	
	7. ng-touched :-->
		- It means that you touched on it.
		- You focus on it and then you steped out that means touched.
		
	
	Eg:--
		<span *ngIf="addCustomerFormGrp.controls.phone.hasError('required') && addCustomerFormGrp.controls.phone.touched">
			{{'This field is required'}}
		</span>
		
	Eg:--
		<span *ngIf="addCustomerFormGrp.controls.phone.hasError('min') || addCustomerFormGrp.controls.phone.hasError('max')">
			Phone Should be 10 digits
		</span>
		
	So we are getting the error message based on what type of validator it is and then we are checking .touched.
