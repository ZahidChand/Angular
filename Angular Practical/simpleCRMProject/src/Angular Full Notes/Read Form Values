		Read Form Values
		
	We can read data back from the form.
	
	1. Get Value Of Entire Form
		-this.addPartsForm.value
		
	--> When we say form.value then we get all the data back of form.
	
		
	2. Get Value Of Specific Form Control
		- this.addPartsForm.get('partName').value
		
	--> In this you can get any specific value from form 
	--> Suppose there are 20 feilds in and we want only specific one then we an get by  .get('FeildName').value .
	 
		
	3. Get Value On Changes
		- this.addPartsForm.valueChanges
		
	--> There can also be situation that we want value when data is change like in dropdown radio button etc .
	 So in that case valueChange is used.
