    *** HTTP INTERCEPTORS
    
      -->   It intercept and handles and HTTP Request or HTTP Response.
      
      -->   Most interceptors transforms the outgoing request before passing it to the next interceptors in the chain,
      by calling next.handle(transformedReq) .
      
      -->   An interceptor may transform theresponce event stream , as well by applying additional RXJS operators on the stream returned by next,handle().
      
      -->   It is also rare but valid for interceptors to return multiple responses on a event stream for a single request.
      
      --> Intercepts any outgoing request so we can add more details
          -- mostly we add 
              --authentications tokens
          -- Headers
              -- user name
              -- roles
           --Tokens
           
        --> iT is also use for common error handling across all HTTP Requests.
        
        For Eg--->
            If we want to get values for backend then we send get request and if value is present in DB it will return us that value.
            And if there is no value inside the DB then it will show us an error .
            Then that error we should handle.
            
            So from  wherever we call that method the it wil give us that error so we need to handle it every time.
            Now what if we handle that error once and call each time that would be better.
            So with the help of HTTP Interceptors we can do that.
            
         --->   Angular provides us cli command to create interceptor
            Syntax -->
                  ng g interceptor <name>
