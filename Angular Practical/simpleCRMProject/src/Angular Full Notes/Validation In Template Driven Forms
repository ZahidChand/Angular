		Validations in Template Driven Form
		
	Adding Validation in Template Drivenr Form
		- Disable  the form
			--> Disable the form when the form is not valid.
			
		- HTML5 Validations
			--> Required
			--> minLength
			--> maxLength
			--> checked
	
	So this are all default HTML5 vlidations.
	This are good when you are building a basic form , but if you are trying to make any advance complex form structure and custom validations then you always go with Reactive Form.
