		Reactive Forms In Angular
		
	
	- Reactive forms are a way to create Forms in angular applications.
	
	- What's different is how we implement , design and handel the form anmd the data.
	
	- All the form elements, user interaction and validations are handled in the component class.
	
	- We will make use of agular's built in formGroup and formControl.
	 
	- Using reactive forms we can control better data binding.
	
	- We can Exclusive define custom regular expression patterns of error handling.
	
	- We will need to import ReactiveFormModule in our app module.
	
	- Very flexible and allows user to define develop complex requirement of form.
	
	- More logic in component and less in HTML template.
	
	
----- Angular maintains the state information of forms at all times.
