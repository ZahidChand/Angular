		Template Driven Form  
		
	Template driven form are way from which we can achive forms in angular.
	
	Easy to use.
	
	Simple and straight forwards.
	
	All validations, form elements are all defined in the template file.
	
	Forms are tracked automatically.
	
	Whenever we talk about Template driven form then we use Two Way Data Binding .
	
	Most of the code reside in template file.
	
	Validations are mostly the default HTML5 Validations.

	Minimum code is inside component and maximum code in inside the template i.e HTML file
		
	So because of that unit testing will be challenge.
	
	
	***Step By Step Process for Template Driven Form:---
		Step 1 :--->
		
		- For template driven form - FormsModule needs to be imported.
		- If we Do Not Import this then we will get error when doing two way data binding.
		- Add the module into the array list of imports.
		
		Step 2 :--->
		
		-ngForm
			--> Form name as template variable using "#" for eg #loginForm
		-ngModel
			--> Every form feild should have a "name" attribute and ngModel attached to it.
