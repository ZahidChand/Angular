There are lot of files when we create new project but we will look only few of them which are important 

1. package.json
	This file contain dependencies , library, modules that are required for your angular applications to work

The packages get installed when you enter command ng new FolderName
and all the packages get installed inside node.modules folder.

2.src Folder

In src folder we have main.ts file which is entry part to our angular applications

We also have app folder inside src which have app.module.ts which is root module of our applications and also app.component.ts which is root component of our applications

When we run command ng serve our the execution comes to main.ts.
Inside main.ts we bootstrapModule(AppModule).

In appmodule we have 2 main files html and .ts file
html contain view part and .ts contain logic part
