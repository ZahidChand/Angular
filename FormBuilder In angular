		FormBuilder In Angular
		
	FormBuilder is an abstraction layer which makes it easy to design and build our forms.
	
	FormBuilder is used when we work on complex form structure.
	
	FormBuilder has 3 important things
		1. FormControl
		2. FOrmGroup
		3. FormArray
		
	We can go with FormBuilder because it has both formControl and formGroup.
	
	eg:-->
		public addPartsForm :FormGroup
	
		this.addPartsForm = new FormGroup({
			'partId': new formControl();
			'partName': new formControl();
			'partDesc': new formControl();
		});
	
	and other way is
	we need to import formGroup and also write in constructor 
	
		this.addPartsForm : fb.group({
			'partId': new formControl();
			'partName': new formControl();
			'partDesc': new formControl();
		});
		
	We can do our work with both whatever formGroup can also done by formBuilder.
	
	But most of the recommended one is using formBuilder.
	Most of the organizations prefer to work with formBuilder.
