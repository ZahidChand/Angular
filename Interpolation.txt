TEXT INTERPOLATION:-

Text interpolation lets you incorporate dynamic string values into your HTML templates. Use interpolation to dynamically change what appears in an application view, such as displaying a custom greeting that includes the user's name.


Interpolation uses the double curly braces {{ }} as delimiters.

In interpolation we can do calculations as well
eg{{2+4}} then output will be 6
same you can do other arithmatic operations.

Also you can perform concatination of two strings
eg {{"Welcome " + title}}

Output will be welcome and whatever the title name is that will be passed inside the title. 

With interpolation you can also perform certain operation like finding length , upperCase, lowerCase etc
eg
{{title.length}}
{{title.lowerCase()}}
{{title.upperCase()}}
and similarly  you can create your own method


These were the things you can do in interpolation

Now lets see what you cannot do in interpolation
1. Assigning a expression to a variable
if we write {{a = 2+3}}
 we cannot get output because it will give an error that have Template Parse Error.
So we cannot assign in interpolation
When you want to get access global variable such as window ,screeen etc you cannot get access to it 
{{window.location.href}}
 you will get an error  cannot read property location of undefined.
So the template dost not know about global javascript variables.

But if you want to do that you want global javascript variable to display in interpolation then you can simply define in class and use that variable in html interpolation

.ts
public siteUrl = window.location.href

and in .html
{{siteUrl}}

output will be displayed .
http://localhost:4200/
