Components are the main building block for Angular applications. Each component consists of:
HTML
CSS
TYPESCRIPT

An HTML template that declares what renders on the page
A Typescript class that defines behavior
A CSS selector that defines how the component is used in a template

COMPONENT METADATA:--

The @Component decorator identifies the class immediately below it as a component class, and specifies its metadata.

When a class doesnot have @Component decorator in that then its a normal class not a component class.
When you add @Component decorator in class then it behaves like component class.
