Prerequisit for angular are
HTML
CSS
JAVASCRIPT

We dont need to master this but basic understanding should be there before starting Angular.

********************************************************************************************************
						***BASIC***
TYPESCRIPT:-
We should start with Typescript 
Typescript is very important before starting with angular .
You should have basic knowledge of typescript and so working on angular makes much more easy.

ANGULAR CLI:-
	With the help of angular cli you can make projects with simple commands just with one line of command code.
Apart from creating projects angular cli also performs many tasks such as deploy,testing,bunddling.

NGMODULE:-
	NgModules are basic building blocks of angular applications.

Components:-
	Angular has a component based architecture .
 Components are combination of class i.e logic , template i.e html and metadata that ties your class and template

TEMPLATE SYNTAX:-
	1.Interpolation
	2.Property Binding
	3.Event Binding
	4.Two Way Binding
	5.Pipes
	6.Template Reference variable

DIRECTIVES:-
	Directives are custome html elements that are used in angular application.

There are three types of directives in angular:
	1.Components( Which you saw already before)
	2.Structural Directives:--
		This directives change DOM layout by addind and removing DOM elements.
 a.ngIf
 b.ngFor
 c.ngSwitch

	3.Attributes Directives:--
  To Change the behaviour of another directives ,component or  elements

COMPONENT STYLING:
	For adding and removing classes you have ngClass directives.
	For adding styles you have ngStyle directives.

COMPONENT INTERACTION:--
Input and Output  decorators

Input is used to pass data from parent to child
and output is used to pass data from child to parent.

COMPONENTS LIFECYCLE 

Different phases of lifecycle and different phases of lifecycle hooks 
Also  Learn About API how to call APIs from angular to backend api.

	(Once got basic understanding of Template driven form procees to Reactive Forms)

		b. Form Control
		c.Form Control
		d.setValue and path value
		e.formBuilder serivices
