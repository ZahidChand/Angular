Parametrized Routes

We can configure and send parameteres to our routes.
We need to congigure the route and mention that the value is dynamic.
{path :'product/:id',component:'componentName'}
 
Eg :---   
    product/10
    product/10/20
    
 We can read the values in the component class and process the parameter.
 
  URLs will look something like this 
 
      http://localhost.com/user/10 -> it means that get the user with Id as 10 

      http://localhost.com/search/mh/pune -> it means that search state Maharashtra and city Pune 

      http://localhost.com/user/10/photos/34 -> it means that get  user whose  id = 10 and whose photo id = 34 .
  
  We can also write dynamic urls params
  
  While writing dynamic URLs/Params - make sure you write :(colon) for dynamic data
